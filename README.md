# Project Background

I built this project based on the job requirements and responsibilities for Full-stack engineer, front-end focused role at [Lumen Energy](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/lumen.energy/ca4a1b07-43af-47c3-86d3-e84a4f9c3232?utm_source=remote_rocketship&ref=remote_rocketship). 

The minimum viable product for this is creating a dashboard that shows different data based on a personâ€™s role. 

Here are the features:

- users should be able to sign up
- users should be able to sign in
- users should be able to see data on the dashboard
- users can see data based on their role

To be able to build this project in a timely manner and to be able to have a consistent design for future features, I leveraged a [tailwind dashboard template](https://github.com/cruip/tailwind-dashboard-template) from Cruip as they have design files available. I also leveraged Firebase and Firestore for the backend.
